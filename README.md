This is my `neovim` config. On a machine without `neovim` just run the
[intall.sh](./scripts/install.sh) script:

```bash
cd $HOME
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/specialkapa/nvim-config/main/script/install.sh | bash
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The installation script accommodates only Ubuntu and ArchLinux distros.

> [!NOTE]
> if the command above does not work just copy the raw script and past it in
> a file called _install.sh_ in the $HOME directory.
